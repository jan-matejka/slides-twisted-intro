Usage
=======
just open http://yaccz.github.com/slides-twisted-intro/

or clone and open the index.html in a browser (tested on chromium)

Build & libraries
==================
The page uses deck.js, highlight.js and jq-linedtextarea hacked to work together acceptably.

As I need this to work right after cloning, w/o needed to go through build step, it contains derived files (product of build step) in /built/ dir.
